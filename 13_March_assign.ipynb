This description is called the R² (“R-Squared”) of the model. It is a ratio: R2=variance of fitted model valuesvariance of response values."

Since this p-value is less than the commonly used significance level of 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there are significant differences between the group means."

    "Ans- Handling missing data in a repeated measures ANOVA can be tricky because the observations are related to each other, and missing values can affect the correlation structure of the data. There are several methods that can be used to handle missing data in a repeated measures ANOVA, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "Listwise deletion: This method involves deleting any cases that have missing data on any variable included in the analysis. While this is the simplest method, it can lead to biased results if the missing data are not missing completely at random (MCAR), meaning that the missingness is not related to the observed or unobserved data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pairwise deletion: This method involves analyzing only the available data for each pair of variables included in the analysis. This method is less restrictive than listwise deletion, but it can lead to biased estimates if the missing data are not MCAR.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imputation: This method involves replacing the missing values with estimated values based on the observed data. There are several types of imputation methods, including mean imputation, regression imputation, and multiple imputation. Imputation can be a good option when the missing data are not MCAR, but the imputation model must be appropriate and carefully selected to avoid biased estimates."
