    "\n",
    "Probability density functions are a statistical measure used to gauge the likely outcome of a discrete value (e.g., the price of a stock or ETF). PDFs are plotted on a graph typically resembling a bell curve, with the probability of the outcomes lying below the curve."

    "Q3: What are some examples of situations where the normal distribution might be used as a model? Explain how the parameters of the normal distribution relate to the shape of the distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans- The normal distribution is a common probability distribution used in statistics to model real-world phenomena. It is also known as the Gaussian distribution or the bell curve distribution. Here are some examples of situations where the normal distribution might be used as a model:IQ scores: IQ scores also tend to follow a normal distribution, with most people having an average score and fewer people having either a very low or very high score.\n",
    "\n",
    "The normal distribution is characterized by two parameters: the mean and the standard deviation. The mean determines the center of the distribution, while the standard deviation determines its spread. The larger the standard deviation, the more spread out the distribution is, while the smaller the standard deviation, the more tightly clustered the distribution is around the mean.\n",

    "\n",
    "Ans- 1. It is the foundation of statistical inference: Normal distribution plays a key role in statistical inference, which is the process of using data to draw conclusions about a population. Many statistical tests and methods rely on the assumption that the data is normally distributed.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. It allows for accurate predictions: Normal distribution allows us to make accurate predictions and estimate probabilities based on the observed data. For example, in finance, normal distribution is used to model the distribution of stock prices, which allows investors to predict the likelihood of a particular event, such as a stock price increase or decrease.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Ans- Bernoulli distribution is a probability distribution that describes the outcomes of a single binary event that can result in either success or failure, with a given probability of success. It is named after Swiss mathematician Jacob Bernoulli, who introduced the concept in the 17th century.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example of a Bernoulli distribution is the outcome of flipping a fair coin, where the event of getting heads can be considered a success with a probability of 0.5, and the event of getting tails can be considered a failure with a probability of 0.5. Another example is the probability of a patient recovering from a disease after taking a particular medication.\n",
