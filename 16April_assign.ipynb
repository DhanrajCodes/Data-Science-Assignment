    "Ans- Boosting works by combining multiple weak learners (models that perform slightly better than random guessing) sequentially to create a strong learner. The process involves the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initial Model**: Train the first weak learner on the original dataset.\n",

    "2. **Weighted Training**: Assign higher weights to the instances that are misclassified or have higher errors by the previous weak learner.\n",

    "4. **Weighted Combination**: Combine the predictions of all weak learners, giving higher weight to the predictions of more accurate weak learners.\n",

    "\n",
    "By iteratively focusing on difficult-to-predict instances, boosting aims to improve the overall predictive performance of the model. The process continues until a predefined number of weak learners is reached or until no further improvement is observed."
