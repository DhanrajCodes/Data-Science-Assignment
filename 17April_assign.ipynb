    "Q1. What is Gradient Boosting Regression?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans- Gradient Boosting Regression is a machine learning technique used for regression tasks. It is an ensemble learning method that combines multiple weak regression models sequentially to create a strong regression model. \n",
    "\n",
    "In Gradient Boosting Regression:\n",
    "1. Weak regression models (usually decision trees) are trained sequentially on the residuals (errors) of the previous models.\n",
    "2. Each subsequent model focuses on minimizing the residuals of the previous model, gradually improving the overall prediction.\n",
    "3. The final prediction is the sum of predictions from all weak models, where each prediction is weighted by a factor determined during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gradient Boosting Regression is known for its high predictive accuracy and robustness against overfitting. It's widely used in various regression problems across different domains."

    "Q2. What is a weak learner in Gradient Boosting?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans- In Gradient Boosting, a weak learner refers to a base model that performs slightly better than random guessing but is not highly accurate on its own. Typically, weak learners used in Gradient Boosting are simple models, such as shallow decision trees or linear regression models. These weak learners are combined sequentially to create a strong learner that can make accurate predictions. Each weak learner focuses on learning from the mistakes (residuals) of the previous models, gradually improving the overall predictive performance of the ensemble."

    "Q3. What is the intuition behind the Gradient Boosting algorithm?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans- The intuition behind the Gradient Boosting algorithm is to sequentially build a strong predictive model by combining multiple weak learners in a way that each subsequent learner corrects the errors (residuals) made by the previous ones. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a simplified intuition:\n",
    "1. Start with an initial weak learner that makes predictions based on the data.\n",
    "2. Train subsequent weak learners to focus on the mistakes (residuals) of the previous models, adjusting their predictions to reduce the errors.\n",
    "3. Combine the predictions of all weak learners, giving higher weight to the predictions that have less error, resulting in a final strong learner.\n",
    "4. The process continues iteratively until the model achieves the desired level of performance or a predefined number of weak learners are reached.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, Gradient Boosting iteratively improves the model by learning from its mistakes, gradually reducing errors, and building a highly accurate ensemble model."

    "Q4. How does Gradient Boosting algorithm build an ensemble of weak learners?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans- The Gradient Boosting algorithm builds an ensemble of weak learners sequentially by iteratively minimizing the residuals (errors) of the previous models. Here's a simplified explanation of the process:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Start**: Initialize the ensemble with a simple model (e.g., a single decision tree).\n",
    "  \n",
    "2. **Predict**: Make predictions using the current ensemble model.\n",
    "  \n",
    "3. **Calculate Residuals**: Calculate the residuals by comparing the predictions to the actual values.\n",
    "  \n",
    "4. **Train Weak Learner**: Train a new weak learner (e.g., another decision tree) on the residuals. This learner focuses on correcting the errors made by the current ensemble.\n",
    "  \n",
    "5. **Update Ensemble**: Add the new weak learner to the ensemble, adjusting its contribution based on a learning rate (or step size) to prevent overfitting.\n",
    "  \n",
    "6. **Repeat**: Repeat steps 2-5 until a predefined number of weak learners is reached or until the model converges.\n",
    "\n",
    "By iteratively adding weak learners that focus on the mistakes of the previous ones, Gradient Boosting gradually builds a strong ensemble model that can accurately predict the target variable."
