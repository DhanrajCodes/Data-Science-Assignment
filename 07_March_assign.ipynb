The mean is used to measure the central tendency of a dataset when the data is normally distributed. The median is used to measure the central tendency of a dataset when the data is skewed. The mode is used to measure the central tendency of a dataset when the data is categorical."

The standard deviation is the square root of the variance. The range is used to describe the spread of a dataset when the data is normally distributed. The variance is used to describe the spread of a dataset when the data is skewed. The standard deviation is used to describe the spread of a dataset when the data is normally distributed."

The area of the circle is proportional to the size of the set. The size of the intersection of two sets is represented by the area of the overlapping region of the circles."

    "\n",
    "Ans: Skewness is a measure of the asymmetry of the probability distribution of a real-valued random variable about its mean. The skewness value can be positive or negative, or undefined. A positive value of skewness indicates that there is more weight in the right tail of the distribution. A negative value of skewness indicates that there is more weight in the left tail of the distribution. A skewness value of zero indicates that the distribution is perfectly symmetrical."
