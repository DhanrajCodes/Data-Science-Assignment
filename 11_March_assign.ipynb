    "Ans- A t-test is used when the population standard deviation is unknown or when the sample size is small (usually less than 30). The test uses the t-distribution to calculate the probability of obtaining a difference in means as extreme as the one observed in the sample, assuming the null hypothesis is true. The degrees of freedom for the t-distribution depend on the sample size.\n",

    "A z-test, on the other hand, is used when the population standard deviation is known or when the sample size is large (usually greater than 30).

    "Suppose a factory produces light bulbs and each bulb has a 2% chance of being defective. A quality control inspector randomly selects a bulb from a shipment and tests it. If the bulb is defective, there is a 90% chance the test will correctly identify it as such. However, if the bulb is not defective, there is a 5% chance the test will incorrectly identify it as defective. The inspector tests a bulb and finds that it is defective. What is the probability that the bulb is actually defective?\n",

    "P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)\n",

    "Provide an example of a scenario where a larger sample size would result in a smaller margin of error.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans- The margin of error in a confidence interval is the range of values above and below the point estimate (such as the sample mean or proportion) within which the true population parameter is expected to lie with a certain degree of confidence. It represents the degree of uncertainty in the estimation process.\n",
    "\n",
    "The margin of error is affected by several factors, including the level of confidence, the size of the sample, and the variability of the data. Generally, as the sample size increases, the margin of error decreases. This is because a larger sample size provides more information about the population and reduces the sampling error. In other words, a larger sample size leads to a more precise estimate of the population parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example scenario where a larger sample size would result in a smaller margin of error:\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose a company wants to estimate the average annual salary of its employees.

    "\n",
    "Using the formula for the confidence interval, we get:\n",
    "\n",
    "Margin of error = z*(σ/√n) = 1.96*(5,000/√100) = $980\n",

    "$50,000 ± $980 or ($49,020, $50,980)\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose the company takes a larger sample of 500 employees instead. Using the same formula, we get:\n",
