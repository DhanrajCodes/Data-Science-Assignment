    "Q1. What is an ensemble technique in machine learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans- An ensemble technique in machine learning combines multiple individual models to improve predictive performance. These models can be of the same type (e.g., decision trees) or different types (e.g., decision trees, neural networks). By aggregating the predictions of multiple models, ensemble methods often yield more accurate and robust predictions compared to individual models. Common ensemble techniques include bagging, boosting, and stacking."

    "Q2. Why are ensemble techniques used in machine learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans- Ensemble techniques are used in machine learning because they often yield better predictive performance compared to individual models. By combining multiple models, ensemble methods can mitigate the weaknesses of individual models, improve generalization, and reduce overfitting. They are particularly effective when dealing with complex or noisy data and can provide more robust predictions across different datasets."

    "Q3. What is bagging?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans- Bagging, short for Bootstrap Aggregating, is an ensemble technique in machine learning where multiple models are trained independently on different subsets of the training data, sampled with replacement. These models are typically of the same type (e.g., decision trees). Bagging helps reduce variance and improve generalization by averaging the predictions of multiple models."

    "Q4. What is boosting?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans- Boosting is an ensemble technique in machine learning where multiple weak learners (models that are slightly better than random guessing) are trained sequentially. Each subsequent model focuses on the examples that the previous models struggled with, thus gradually improving overall predictive performance. Boosting combines the predictions of all weak learners using a weighted sum to make the final prediction. It aims to reduce bias and variance, leading to better generalization."

    "\n",
    "Ans- No, ensemble techniques are not always better than individual models. While ensemble methods often yield improved predictive performance, there are scenarios where individual models may outperform ensembles. Factors such as the quality of the data, the choice of models, and the specific characteristics of the problem can influence the effectiveness of ensemble techniques. Additionally, ensembles come with added complexity and computational cost, which may not always be justified depending on the problem at hand. Therefore, it's essential to evaluate the performance of both ensemble methods and individual models to determine the most suitable approach for a given task."

    "Q7. How is the confidence interval calculated using bootstrap?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans- The confidence interval using bootstrap is calculated by resampling the dataset with replacement multiple times to create a distribution of sample statistics (e.g., mean, median). From this distribution, percentiles or standard deviation can be used to determine the range of values that captures the desired level of confidence."

    "Ams- Bootstrap is a resampling technique used to estimate the sampling distribution of a statistic by repeatedly resampling the original dataset with replacement. Here are the steps involved in bootstrap:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Sample with Replacement**: Randomly select samples from the original dataset with replacement until the new dataset has the same size as the original dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Calculate Statistic**: Calculate the desired statistic (e.g., mean, median, standard deviation) on the resampled dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Repeat**: Repeat steps 1 and 2 a large number of times (e.g., thousands of times) to create a distribution of the statistic.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Estimate Confidence Interval**: Use percentiles or standard deviation of the statistic distribution to estimate the confidence interval.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bootstrap allows us to estimate the variability of a statistic and assess the uncertainty associated with it without making strong parametric assumptions about the data distribution."
