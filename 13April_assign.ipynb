    "Q1. What is Random Forest Regressor?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans- \n",
    "Random Forest Regressor is an ensemble learning technique used for regression tasks. It is based on the Random Forest algorithm, which builds multiple decision trees during training and combines their predictions to make a final prediction. In a Random Forest Regressor:\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple decision trees are trained on random subsets of the training data.\n",
    "Each tree predicts a continuous value (regression) based on the input features.\n",
    "The final prediction is the average (or weighted average) of the predictions from all the trees in the forest."

    "Q2. How does Random Forest Regressor reduce the risk of overfitting?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans- Random Forest Regressor reduces the risk of overfitting through several mechanisms:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Random Subsampling**: It trains each decision tree on a random subset of the training data, sampled with replacement. This randomness helps reduce the correlation between trees and promotes diversity in the ensemble, which can mitigate overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Feature Randomness**: At each split in the tree, only a random subset of features is considered for splitting. This prevents individual trees from becoming too specialized and overfitting to specific features.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Ensemble Averaging**: The final prediction is the average (or weighted average) of predictions from all trees in the forest. This averaging process helps smooth out noise and reduce the impact of outliers, leading to more robust predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Tree Pruning**: Random Forest Regressor typically grows trees with a maximum depth or a minimum number of samples per leaf, preventing individual trees from becoming overly complex and fitting noise in the data.\n",

    "Q3. How does Random Forest Regressor aggregate the predictions of multiple decision trees?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans- Random Forest Regressor aggregates the predictions of multiple decision trees by averaging (or taking the weighted average) of the individual tree predictions. Each decision tree in the Random Forest Regressor independently predicts a continuous value (regression), and the final prediction is obtained by averaging the predictions from all the trees in the forest. This aggregation process helps to smooth out noise, reduce variance, and improve the overall predictive performance of the model."

    "4. **min_samples_leaf**: The minimum number of samples required to be at a leaf node.\n",
    "5. **max_features**: The maximum number of features to consider for splitting a node.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Model Complexity**:\n",
    "   - Random Forest Regressor: Consists of multiple decision trees, resulting in a more complex model.\n",

    "   - Random Forest Regressor: Tends to have lower variance and is less prone to overfitting due to the ensemble averaging of multiple trees.\n",

    "\n",
    "3. **Generalization**:\n",
    "   - Random Forest Regressor: Often provides better generalization performance, especially when dealing with complex datasets or noisy data.\n",
    "   - Decision Tree Regressor: May struggle to generalize well, particularly with high-dimensional or noisy data.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Interpretability**:\n",
    "   - Random Forest Regressor: Generally less interpretable compared to a single decision tree due to the ensemble nature of the model.\n",
    "   - Decision Tree Regressor: Provides more straightforward interpretability, as the decision process is represented in a single tree structure."
